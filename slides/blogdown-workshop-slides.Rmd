if (!requireNamespace("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/blogdown")

# Make a site

---

# Create a new R Project

You are recommended to use the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), but you do not have to.

- Create a new R Project from the menu `File -> New Project -> New Directory`

---

# Update R Project Options

https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/rstudio-ide.html#fig:project-options

---

# Updated RStudio Project Templates

https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/09/13/rstudio-v1.1---the-little-things/

![](images/rstudio-project-templates.png)

Note: you'll be able to install Hugo automatically if you use this method.


---

# Build your site

- Default theme (*we will work with this tonight*)

```{r eval = FALSE}
blogdown::new_site() 
```

--

- Different theme

```{r eval = FALSE}
blogdown::new_site(theme = "gcushen/hugo-academic", 
                   theme_example = TRUE)
```

--

- Change your mind
    
```{r eval = FALSE}
blogdown::install_theme("gcushen/hugo-academic", 
                        theme_example = TRUE, 
                        update_config = TRUE)
```

# Hugo Directory Structure

https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/

Know your way around:

```
.
├── archetypes
├── config.toml
├── content
├── data
├── layouts
├── static
└── themes
```


---

# Overriding vs editing

https://gohugo.io/themes/customizing/

> *When you use a theme cloned from its git repository, do not edit the theme’s files directly. Instead, theme customization in Hugo is a matter of overriding the templates made available to you in a theme. This provides the added flexibility of tweaking a theme to meet your needs while staying current with a theme’s upstream.*

--

Note which folders are *empty* at the top level of your project:
```
.
├── archetypes <<-
├── config.toml
├── content
├── data <<-
├── layouts <<-
├── static <<-
└── themes
```

---

# Serve site

- Console
```{r eval = FALSE}
blogdown::serve_site()
```

--

- or RStudio Addin (*recommended*)

---

# LiveReLoad

https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/a-quick-example.html

1. Edit + save triggers

--

1. Blocks your console **by design**

--

1. Don't try to view in your *teeny tiny* RStudio viewer; click: `Show in new window`

---

# Edit your site


---

# Edit 1: add a logo

1. Move `01-images` folder to `static/`

--

1. Rename folder `images/` (so now you have a `static/images/` folder with 2 .png files in it)

--

1. Update `config.toml` and save

```toml
    [params.logo]
    url = "rladies-r-logo.png" <<-
    width = 50
    height = 50
    alt = "Logo"
```

---

class: center

# Edit 1: did we add a logo?

![](images/edit1-outcome.png)

---

# Edit 1: did we learn something?

Yes!

--

We saw:

`/themes/<THEME>/static/images/logo.png`

--

Could be overwritten by:

`/static/images/<rladies-r-logo.png>`

--

The filename `<rladies-r-logo.png>` could have been anything, because there is a place to specify the url in the `config.toml` file

> *This only works for templates that Hugo “knows about” (i.e., that follow its convention for folder structure and naming). If a theme imports template files in a creatively named directory, Hugo won’t know to look for the local /layouts first.*

https://gohugo.io/themes/customizing/

---

# Edit 2: update the "About" page

1. Move `02-about.md` file to `content/`

--

1. Delete the existing file `about.md`

--

1. Rename `02-about.md` --> `about.md` <sup>1<sup>


.footnote[
[1] you should still have *LiveReLoad* running...
]

---

class: center

# Edit 2: did we change the about page?

![](images/edit2-outcome.png)

---

# Edit 3: basic configurations

- Note the last line 😉

```toml
baseurl = "/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "R-Ladies PDX" <<-
theme = "hugo-lithium-theme"
googleAnalytics = ""
disqusShortname = ""
ignoreFiles = ["\\.Rmd$", "\\.Rmarkdown$", "_files$", "_cache$"]
enableEmoji = true <<-
```

--

- In your "About" page, :heart: should now be ❤️


---

# Edit 4: edit the main menu

```toml
[[menu.main]]
    name = "About"
    url = "/about/"
    weight = 1 <<-
[[menu.main]]
    name = "Meetups" <<-
    url = "https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-PDX/" <<-
    weight = 2 <<-
[[menu.main]]
    name = "Twitter"
    url = "https://twitter.com/RLadiesPDX" <<-
    weight = 3 <<-
```

---

class: center

# Edit 4: did we change the navigation bar + links?

![](images/edit4-outcome.png)


---

# Edit 5: customize CSS

1. In `static/` create a new directory `css`

--

1. Move `05-rladies.css` file to `static/css/`

--

1. Rename `05-rladies.css` --> `rladies.css`

--

1. In `config.toml`, add last line: <sup>1</sup>

```toml
[params]
    description = "A website built through Hugo and blogdown."
    customCSS = ["css/rladies.css"] <<-
```


.footnote[
[1] how did I know the name of this parameter? 🕵🏽
/themes/<THEME>/layouts/partials/head.html
]

# Edit 5: did we change the CSS?

![](images/edit5-outcome.png)

---

# Edit 6: add font awesome icons

You know the drill now- always remove my numbers, `##-`, that are prepended to filename

1. Move `font-awesome.min.css` to `static/css/`

1. Create a new directory in `layouts/` called `partials/`

1. Move other `head_custom.html` and `nav.html` to `layouts/partials/` 
  - Why? Let's open them up and take a look

---

# Edit 6: final steps to add icons

Make changes to these sections in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[[menu.main]]
    name = "About"
    pre = "" <<-
    url = "/about/"
    weight = 1
[[menu.main]]
    name = "Meetups"
    pre = "fa-meetup" <<-
    url = "https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-PDX/" <<-
    weight = 2
[[menu.main]]
    name = "Twitter"
    pre = "fa-twitter" <<-
    url = "https://twitter.com/RLadiesPDX"
    weight = 3
    
[params]
    description = "A website built through Hugo and blogdown."
    customCSS = ["css/rladies.css", "css/font-awesome.min.css"] <<-
```
